# Notion Sync

Utility to sync markdown documentation into notion using the new notion public API.

This project differs from the existing alternatives via:

- This uses the public api and not the unofficial API
- Built in mind to be able to maintain pages in notion and via a repository together
- Built in ruby

## Roadmap

- Parse markdown into an AST that represents notion blocks
- Sync nested blocks to notion
- Work across multiple files
- Sync images/files
